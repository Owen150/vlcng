1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:04,960
Get ready for what's coming.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,000
Jackson Storm is part of the next
generation of high tech race.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Look at Jackson Storm.
Jackson Storm.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,000
Jackson Storm in a class of his own.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,520
Hey,

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,920
Cha, you got a good run.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,680
You have no idea what a pleasure
it is for me to finally beat you.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,160
Did you say meet or beat?

9
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,600
I think you you heard me.

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,120
Enjoy your retirement.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,480
You'll never be the racer you once were.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,920
You can't turn back the clock, kids,

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,400
but you can wind it up again.

14
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,680
The racing world is changing.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,160
Treadmills into virtual reality.

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,960
Still working on that and
interactive race simulation.

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,320
You have jumped a barrier.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,280
You are

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,320
going.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,760
You have cash.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,560
We got some work to do.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,240
I am so excited that I get to train you.

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,440
Visualized feeding

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,360
the Beach ate me every week.
Veteran research.

25
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:37,120
Retires to make room for these
younger, faster research.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,600
Have you given any thought
of retiree or no questions?

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,440
Pop out is.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
You'Ll never be as fast as Storm.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,080
But you can be smarter.
Good luck out there.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,760
You're gonna need it.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,320
I decide when I'm done.

32
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,920
You are not winning this.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
I'm coming for you to warm it.
