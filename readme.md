## VLC Next Generation

##### Firstly switch to `develop` branch using `git checkout develop`

##### Once you clone the repo please run `npm i` at the root of the cloned project.

##### Also install `yarn` using `npm install --global yarn`

##### One more thing, if you happen to need to extend tailwindcss you need to build tailwindcss. To do so run `npm run build:css` at the root of the project.
